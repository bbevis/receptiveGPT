If the instances of police brutality and incarceration were being perpetuated on the majority class there would be no end to the public confrontation.","That's just it, the instances of police brutality and incarceration ARE being perpetuated on the majority class, they just are not reported on at the same rate, nor are they headlines on TV and print news every time. The outrage is being stoked by groups who are trying to make money off of the trials and tribulations of certain groups, all of the information about BLM that has come to light in the past year shows. Are there horrible police officers out there? Of course there are. Just like there are horrible people in every work environment. But we don't normally blame a whole profession for a few people's actions. For instance, every year there are nurses that kill patients, either through negligence or outright on purpose. But, we do not, as a society, say that all nurses are bad and out to kill patients. Also, lets look at all of the area where police forces have been parried down and down. All of those areas have massively increased crime and violent crime over the past 3 years. We were told that getting rid of so many police would lessen crime, and yet we see the complete opposite.",R_d73MA96RB2cGxRT_2,"While there's no denying that there have been some blatantly WRONG and disgusting actions taken by police in some cases, burning down cities, looting, having a free-for-all on crime is beyond an ""overblown reaction."" And this isn't just a minority issue, I'm tired of people acting like the same things don't happen to white suspects who aren't cooperating with police, as well. People should just follow police instruction instead of resisting and arguing, and do the resisting and arguing in court, and things like this would happen drastically less often.",6,8,5,4,1,2,3,7,1,2,8,3,4,5,7,6

Without public pressure and a serious acknowedgement of unqeual protection under the law , these crimes against minority communities would continue to be swept under the rug. Also, if the situations were not broadcast in everyone's living rooms, the general majority public who many times have no experience with these injustices, nor knowlege of how  injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere will feel like they dont have a vested interest in developing solutions to the core issues that cause crime (i.e. lack of economic development, race, community distrust etc).

Are there horrible police officers out there? Of course there are. Just like there are horrible people in every work environment. But we don't normally blame a whole profession for a few people's actions. For instance, every year there are nurses that kill patients, either through negligence or outright on purpose. But, we do not, as a society, say that all nurses are bad and out to kill patients. Also, lets look at all of the area where police forces have been parried down and down.

However, establishing some sort of system or algorithm that prioritizes hiring women over men - again, when their qualifications are the same - would remove unconscious, internalized bias from the decision making process, and potentially better increase women's representation in STEM.

Many police carry their on biases to work with them, like many of us. The difference is that they are armed with guns and the right to shoot to kill. There are instances when the police in question have had work histories that are questionable. Infractions of rules, overstepping authority and so forth. Typically those who say it is overblown are not minorities or if they are they are minorities who themselves are police. There seems to be an understanding that it is not an issue because we have not reach an epic number.

Have you dissected the statistics properly and read which minorities were affected the most? As a Korean woman living in the US, I consider myself a visible minority. I don’t see fellow Korean Americans getting killed by the police on an epic scale. Clearly it’s not happening all across the board with all the minority groups. That is a huge generalization and you know it. So I advise you to carefully look at the statistics and really narrow down which racial groups are affected the most and study why those groups are experiencing this.

I can pull up two instances of white people being gunned down by police that are WORSE than George Floyd!  And guess what, I am pissed that that happened, just like I am pissed that G.

Instead of defunding police....lets put more money in and have them trained properly.  I think people would trust 4 Navy Seals or special Ops guys going into a hostile situation.  So train our cops better so we don't have to see ANY person shot when they don't need to be.  Heck, Special Ops guys wouldn't even kill a civilian just cause he had a gun....only as a last straw.

It is much more easy to just believe the victim instead of the alleged abuser.

However, an instant removal just reinforces the overblown criminal justice system, which often does not follow proper protocol, and does not assume the accused is innocent until proven otherwise.     This is a personal issue for me: I was sexually assaulted on my college campus, and the college was reluctant to offer help. Thankfully, I went to the local police department, which was able to guide me through the proper channels. I did not want the individual removed from campus, and was able to restore our relationship via a restorative justice process facilitated by an outside group.

All criminals are making a wrong choice, that is obvious. It is a police officer's duty to simply stop them, and bring them into custody.

The court system and the government officials can put their many heads together to decide the punishment for that criminal. Simply breaking the law is not reason enough to take someone's life.

The media has portrayed these incidents to be much more common than they actually are, which has fueled the public reaction to be greater than necessary.  The public reaction has largely overlooked the fact that the majority of these incidents have been started with a suspect resisting a lawful arrest.  It has focused almost exclusively on the officer's actions and ignored the fact that nothing detrimental would have occurred had the suspect complied with the officer's orders.  There has also been rioting and destruction by some in the public that has not accomplished anything positive.  Another overreaction is in the public's call for an immediate termination or filing of criminal charges against an officer when there has not been adequate time to conduct a thorough investigation of the officer's actions.","Most of your claims are incorrect. The reason they are reported on more is that the severity of the reaction that minorities get by police is much worse compared to, particularly, white individuals (at least in the USA). It is easy to call someone 'resisting arrest' when the officer is almost entirely at fault for even trying to arrest someone when they wouldn't arrest them were they any other person. Claiming that they are often just resisting arrest is a claim that is entirely made up to begin with. Even if they are all resisting arrest, in no situation should an officer kill someone over that, assuming they are not in immediate danger.     Riots are entirely unrelated to this question, and riots are mostly instigated from peaceful demonstrations by false flag and black bloc incidents.

The United States should continue to spend military, economic, and human resources in the fight against ISIS, as part of a greater effort. These organizations are indeed terrorist in ideology and actions regardless of how they view themselves and others. Military action has proven effective in countering ISIS and al Qaeda where they had been geographically entrenched. Proving that these organizations are not divinely invincible in battle is part of the strategy for exposing the weakness of their fundamentalist religious ideology.     It is also important to expose the brutal atrocities committed by these organizations, not just against Western powers, but against civilians in areas controlled by them, including non-Muslims and Muslims they consider heretics, as well as many of their own recruits. Another important strategy is offering deprogramming therapy for prisoners captured from these organizations and those who voluntarily defect.

The removal is for the mental and physical safety of the victim, which is the most important thing.  It shows that the school supports the victim and that sexual violence will not be tolerated.  At that point, the school and police authorities can begin their investigation, but the victim can feel safer that he or she won't run into that person in class or in other school buildings.  The vast, vast majority of alleged victims are telling the truth.  There are always exceptions, but these are few and far between.  We must believe victims and must assume that they are telling the truth, so immediate removal of the accused is certainly necessary, for the safety of the accuser as well as other women on campus.  If an investigation concludes that the assault did not happen, the appropriate corrections can be made at that time.  But it is important to err on the side of caution and protecting victims.","I disagree with your reasoning.  I do feel that you need to trust and believe the victim but you must also give trust and belief to the accused.  We are in a society where you are innocent until proven guilty.  The accused should be detained, questioned and then a decision should be made.  I have first hand experience where my roommate was accused of attacking a woman and after several hours of questions and conversations the girl said, ""I lied, I cheated on my boyfriend and didn't want him to be mad at me and break up"".

I believe any officer that has been accused of excessive force or similar should be suspended while the investigation is being done, especially when there is camera footage of the incident.  And, in many cases, there isn't even an investigation happening unless bystanders or family members pursue it by contacting the media and then the police department feels pressured to look into it.

There is an estimated 400,000 police contacts each day with people in the United States.  The narrative you see in the media and pushed by certain groups would make you think that a large number of these contacts are adversarial up to include a high number of violence from the police towards the public.  This is simply not true.  Think about how many times you have seen officers acting inappropriately on the news.  Compare that to 400,000 each day.  The numbers just dont support this narrative.  Like in any profession you have some police officers that should not be police officers and sometimes they act like criminals.","I just think that even one example of this -- especially when it's caught on video -- is one example too many. Police officers have an incredibly important job, and they need both the proper training and the proper demeanor to do it. The altercations we see on the news speak to the need for broader reforms in the policing industry, with more emphasis on deescalation and less on lethal force, and more comprehensive psychological screenings for potential and current officers.     We also need to look at police culture -- I totally agree with you that the issue is a relatively small number of cops who shouldn't be cops, but in most cases, the department knows about and protects those bad apples instead of dealing with them. Protecting the worst among them taints the entire profession. If good cops could speak out against bad ones without fear of retaliation, the system would function better and we'd all be better off.     And perhaps we should stop relying on police officers to handle situations they're not trained or prepared for, like acute mental crises. Police can't be trained to handle every single situation, so why not have other departments designed to handle the complexities of things like mental-health emergencies? It would take some pressure off officers and help avoid the kinds of stories we see where people end up shot for being mentally ill or autistic, for example.",R_1pKlByD3JaGTqPG_1,"The issue is that the police departments in different parts of the country has been very lenient in the type of reprimand or charges against their ""bad apples"" police members.

That is a huge generalization and you know it. So I advise you to carefully look at the statistics and really narrow down which racial groups are affected the most and study why those groups are experiencing this.

The public reaction has had the benefit of forcing the issues of police misconduct which generations of Americans have experienced with no justice or protection to the forefront of public policy in the country.  Without public pressure and a serious acknowedgement of unqeual protection under the law , these crimes against minority communities would continue to be swept under the rug. Also, if the situations were not broadcast in everyone's living rooms, the general majority public who many times have no experience with these injustices, nor knowlege of how  injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere will feel like they dont have a vested interest in developing solutions to the core issues that cause crime (i.e. lack of economic development, race, community distrust etc). If the instances of police brutality and incarceration were being perpetuated on the majority class there would be no end to the public confrontation.","Yes, I agree with you because this stuff with police brutality is crazy man.

The billions of dollars that we spend on our military have made us a global superpower, but we are not at war with other nations, we are at war with ideals. Nations and governments rise and fall, but ideals can live on indefinitely. While in the past, when the world faced such crises as the rise of Nazis or Communism, we needed to pour as much money as possible towards fighting these evils; however this is no longer the case. War as a whole has changed. Wars are no longer fought on battlefields with uniformed nations against one another. Wars are waged against organizations of loosely networked radicals.

The rise, fall, and subsequent resurrection of civilian-led terrorist organizations such as ISIS and the Taliban have proved this.

Of course, people who hire for STEM positions may have unconscious (or conscious) gender biases, but I think that having a diverse hiring panel would be a better policy than implementing gender quotas.","I think the term ""affirmative action"" often comes with a lot of baggage and it is misunderstood, so I agree with you that programs that further perpetuate a gender divide are not good. However, I think the term or these policies can be applied more broadly. For example, what you suggested of having a diverse hiring panel could be considered a form of affirmative action. I agree that if any of these policies are to be implemented, they should be done carefully so as to not make individuals feel that they are being hired to feel a quote, as opposed to being hired for their qualifications. However, I acknowledge that, as a man, I am one step removed from this and that the voices of women should be just as equally heard. I think the main goal of any affirmative action program is to ensure that those who are qualified (whether they be women or men) are all considered and given a fair chance.",R_CkW81vtK1jnC3uh_1,"I hear your arguments, and they are valid.  A diverse hiring board is essential and should also be implemented.  However, the playing field must still be leveled for women and minorities until such a time that attitudes in this country change.  There are those that will make comments and think that women are only hired due to an inclusive hiring policy.  And those people are exactly why that policy still needs to be in place.  I will not internalize their misogyny.",8,7,6,5,1,2,3,4,1,2,6,3,7,5,8,4

The public reaction has had the benefit of forcing the issues of police misconduct which generations of Americans have experienced with no justice or protection to the forefront of public policy in the country.  Without public pressure and a serious acknowedgement of unqeual protection under the law , these crimes against minority communities would continue to be swept under the rug. Also, if the situations were not broadcast in everyone's living rooms, the general majority public who many times have no experience with these injustices, nor knowlege of how  injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere will feel like they dont have a vested interest in developing solutions to the core issues that cause crime (i.e. lack of economic development, race, community distrust etc). If the instances of police brutality and incarceration were being perpetuated on the majority class there would be no end to the public confrontation.","I hear that you feel that the injustices are being perpetuated against only minorities when that is just simply not true, there is simply just less outcry. Which likely has much to do with the media bias. There is also another key difference here, the ""majority class"" also commits less crime and therefore has less interaction with police even though they are a majority of the population. When one ""class"" has the most interaction with police, it is a no brainer that they will have the most issue with the treatment. Police are not perfect and there are bad apples in all areas of life. There have been definite issues that have come up that were not justified, and those need addressed, but we also need to be truthful to what actually happened in many of these publicized ""injustices"".",R_1F3TqTM0esiYbZG_1,"Yes, I agree with you because this stuff with police brutality is crazy man.

This is simply not true.  Think about how many times you have seen officers acting inappropriately on the news.  Compare that to 400,000 each day.  The numbers just dont support this narrative.  Like in any profession you have some police officers that should not be police officers and sometimes they act like criminals.","I agree that out of estimated 400,000 daily police contacts, only a select few violent or negative interactions are deemed newsworthy. It's helpful to remember that the percentage of news coverage is not a reliable metric, based on the respondent's own sentiments. They are simultaneously blaming the media for pushing a narrative against the police, but also using the media's lack of coverage of negative police interactions as proof that it is not a real problem. Evidence of excessive incidents of negative/violent confrontations between police and minority suspects can be easily observed in publicly available studies comparing, for example, the staggering disparity in arrests or shootings of white suspects vs non-white suspects.",R_ah2h1b5gNlDUWOJ_1,"I agree that the majority of officers may not have negative interactions with minority crime suspects, but I do think that there is a culture of racism in our police.

The media has portrayed these incidents to be much more common than they actually are, which has fueled the public reaction to be greater than necessary.  The public reaction has largely overlooked the fact that the majority of these incidents have been started with a suspect resisting a lawful arrest.  It has focused almost exclusively on the officer's actions and ignored the fact that nothing detrimental would have occurred had the suspect complied with the officer's orders.  There has also been rioting and destruction by some in the public that has not accomplished anything positive.  Another overreaction is in the public's call for an immediate termination or filing of criminal charges against an officer when there has not been adequate time to conduct a thorough investigation of the officer's actions.","The organizations who tract numbers of such incidents clearly indicate that minorities are targeted more often than white people. I understand your view that if the suspect had not resisted, the escalation would not have occured. I also feel that a white person would not have been put into this situation in the first place and so it is important that we look at policies that target minorities. I agree that the rioting that resulted from the high profile cases was not helpful, but it did focus attention on the problems.

There is an estimated 400,000 police contacts each day with people in the United States.  The narrative you see in the media and pushed by certain groups would make you think that a large number of these contacts are adversarial up to include a high number of violence from the police towards the public.  This is simply not true.  Think about how many times you have seen officers acting inappropriately on the news.  Compare that to 400,000 each day.  The numbers just dont support this narrative.  Like in any profession you have some police officers that should not be police officers and sometimes they act like criminals.","I agree with your statement that since there are 400,000 estimated police interactions per day, that the number of interactions where there is brutality or an overreaction by the police to a minority crime suspect is low. However, we can not dismiss how serious these interactions, no matter how few or infrequent, are to society as a whole. The question is about people's reaction to the problem, and for me, it will never be ""overblown"" until it is resolved. Many police officers are afraid of minority suspects, even though they are loathe to admit it. Police are quicker to move to violence or to draw their gun or to expect resistance. There needs to be additional training in dealing with minority suspects so that the actions of the police are more in line with how they react to non-minority suspects.",R_3HIy6dOPGVxOAKv_1,"I just think that even one example of this -- especially when it's caught on video -- is one example too many. Police officers have an incredibly important job, and they need both the proper training and the proper demeanor to do it. The altercations we see on the news speak to the need for broader reforms in the policing industry, with more emphasis on deescalation and less on lethal force, and more comprehensive psychological screenings for potential and current officers. We also need to look at police culture -- I agree with you that the issue is a relatively small number of cops who shouldn't be cops, but in most cases, the department knows about and protects those bad apples instead of dealing with them. Protecting the worst among them taints the entire profession. If good cops could speak out against bad ones without fear of retaliation, the system would function better and we'd all be better off. And perhaps we should stop relying on police officers to handle situations they're not trained or prepared for, like acute mental crises. Police can't be trained to handle every single situation, so why not have other departments designed to handle the complexities of things like mental-health emergencies? It would take some pressure off officers and help avoid the kinds of stories we see where people end up shot for being mentally ill or autistic, for example.",6,7,5,8,1,2,3,4,1,2,6,3,7,4,5,8

Let's suppose these people are resisting arrest. Does this justify the shootings? Just because someone resists arrest does not mean that an officer is justified in shooting the person. Furthermore, it needs to be examined what constitutes ""resisting arrest"", because there are some officers that are inclined to say someone is resisting if a person, for example, recoils when rough-handled or perhaps take a few steps back or away out of fear or adrenaline. Police officers should be trained how to properly handle these things and they should expect people to not exactly enjoy being arrested. Meaning that their instinctual response should not be to draw their weapons and fire. Also riots and protests are also no grounds to shoot your own citizenry, but instead one should look at the *reason* people are protesting or rioting in the first place. Their is always something wrong that is making people upset. The response should not be to attack them as that would only make them more upset and solve nothing. I do agree with your last point that people are quick to call for termination before a thorough investigation, but the officer should be suspended and not allowed to work during the mean time.

In the highly unlikely event that the accused person is found not to have committed the rape or sexual assault (and that's seriously highly unlikely given how rare false accusations are and how its far more likely that rapists and sexual assaulters get away with their crimes than for false accusations to happen) the falsely accused individual can then be allowed back to campus and have their tuition refunded for the time that they were not allowed to attend.",7,6,8,4,1,2,3,5,1,2,6,3,8,5,4,7

The difference isn't that they aren't more common in media than in real life--it's that now they're recorded, so we catch them more often. And we should! The institution of police is in a unique position to have physical power over the people they pledge to protect, so they shouldn't be getting caught up in brutality scandals, should they? As for rioting, rioting is a small cry compared to what minorities have to face against that brutality. It's not just excessive force that leads to death.

The altercations we see on the news speak to the need for broader reforms in the policing industry, with more emphasis on deescalation and less on lethal force, and more comprehensive psychological screenings for potential and current officers.     We also need to look at police culture -- I totally agree with you that the issue is a relatively small number of cops who shouldn't be cops, but in most cases, the department knows about and protects those bad apples instead of dealing with them. Protecting the worst among them taints the entire profession. If good cops could speak out against bad ones without fear of retaliation, the system would function better and we'd all be better off.     And perhaps we should stop relying on police officers to handle situations they're not trained or prepared for, like acute mental crises. Police can't be trained to handle every single situation, so why not have other departments designed to handle the complexities of things like mental-health emergencies?

There is an estimated 400,000 police contacts each day with people in the United States.  The narrative you see in the media and pushed by certain groups would make you think that a large number of these contacts are adversarial up to include a high number of violence from the police towards the public.

Police officers have an incredibly important job, and they need both the proper training and the proper demeanor to do it. The altercations we see on the news speak to the need for broader reforms in the policing industry, with more emphasis on deescalation and less on lethal force, and more comprehensive psychological screenings for potential and current officers. We also need to look at police culture -- I agree with you that the issue is a relatively small number of cops who shouldn't be cops, but in most cases, the department knows about and protects those bad apples instead of dealing with them. Protecting the worst among them taints the entire profession. If good cops could speak out against bad ones without fear of retaliation, the system would function better and we'd all be better off. And perhaps we should stop relying on police officers to handle situations they're not trained or prepared for, like acute mental crises. Police can't be trained to handle every single situation, so why not have other departments designed to handle the complexities of things like mental-health emergencies?

The narrative you see in the media and pushed by certain groups would make you think that a large number of these contacts are adversarial up to include a high number of violence from the police towards the public.  This is simply not true.  Think about how many times you have seen officers acting inappropriately on the news.  Compare that to 400,000 each day.  The numbers just dont support this narrative.

I believe that any time police contact ends in excessive force and death is a problem. The police are one step in the criminal justice system - they are not also judge, jury, and executioner.

A victim should have the right to be believed in their accusation, however one of the major tenets of our judicial system and our society even is the right of the accused to be considered innocent until proven guilty. It is this basic right, enshrined in our constitution that protects citizens from unjust, vengeful or malicious persecution. I would be fine with a victim having extra physical or restraining order protection if deemed necessary, but the rights of the accused are just as important as those of the accuser.

A university, as an institution, has an obligation to protect the safety and well being of its students.  Especially given how incredibly rare false accusations of rape or sexual assault are, the university has an obligation to act to remove the person accused of rape or sexual assault in order to protect the safety and emotional well being of the victim.  To do otherwise is to create an unsafe environment for the victim and to fail in its obligation to protect the safety and well being of students.

The media has portrayed these incidents to be much more common than they actually are, which has fueled the public reaction to be greater than necessary.  The public reaction has largely overlooked the fact that the majority of these incidents have been started with a suspect resisting a lawful arrest.  It has focused almost exclusively on the officer's actions and ignored the fact that nothing detrimental would have occurred had the suspect complied with the officer's orders.  There has also been rioting and destruction by some in the public that has not accomplished anything positive.  Another overreaction is in the public's call for an immediate termination or filing of criminal charges against an officer when there has not been adequate time to conduct a thorough investigation of the officer's actions.","Actually, I believe the public's reaction has been due to the fact that it has rarely been given proper attention to. The select incidents that have been televised actually show proof of harm being done to a human being. Perhaps the human being ""persecuted"" (not ""prosecuted"") by a police officer is outrageous to those of us who value human life. It is not a police officer's place to decide the extent of punishment that a criminal should receive. Especially, not a single officer or even a crew. All criminals are making a wrong choice, that is obvious. It is a police officer's duty to simply stop them, and bring them into custody. Resisting arrest is certainly going to make it harder for the police officer, but they should be solving that problem by taking less drastic measures before considering a lethal ending. The court system and the government officials can put their many heads together to decide the punishment for that criminal. Simply breaking the law is not reason enough to take someone's life. Even mass murderers, school shooters, and serial killers get handcuffed  and taken into the police station for questioning while being handed food and drink to satiate them.",R_4GxhIKEo9tZ1gIN_2,"Though not all (or even most) of these incidents involve resisting arrest, let's concede that point. Let's suppose these people are resisting arrest. Does this justify the shootings? Just because someone resists arrest does not mean that an officer is justified in shooting the person. Furthermore, it needs to be examined what constitutes ""resisting arrest"", because there are some officers that are inclined to say someone is resisting if a person, for example, recoils when rough-handled or perhaps take a few steps back or away out of fear or adrenaline. Police officers should be trained how to properly handle these things and they should expect people to not exactly enjoy being arrested. Meaning that their instinctual response should not be to draw their weapons and fire. Also riots and protests are also no grounds to shoot your own citizenry, but instead one should look at the *reason* people are protesting or rioting in the first place. Their is always something wrong that is making people upset. The response should not be to attack them as that would only make them more upset and solve nothing. I do agree with your last point that people are quick to call for termination before a thorough investigation, but the officer should be suspended and not allowed to work during the mean time. Also, take note of the fact that a police force investigating itself is heavily biased in their own favor and will usually turn up that the officer committed no crime. The investigations should be done by an outside party.",5,8,4,6,1,2,3,7,1,2,5,3,4,6,8,7

The billions of dollars that we spend on our military have made us a global superpower, but we are not at war with other nations, we are at war with ideals. Nations and governments rise and fall, but ideals can live on indefinitely. While in the past, when the world faced such crises as the rise of Nazis or Communism, we needed to pour as much money as possible towards fighting these evils; however this is no longer the case. War as a whole has changed. Wars are no longer fought on battlefields with uniformed nations against one another. Wars are waged against organizations of loosely networked radicals. As long as an extremist has a heartbeat, their warped views will inevitably live on to be passed on to whoever they can proselytize to. The rise, fall, and subsequent resurrection of civilian-led terrorist organizations such as ISIS and the Taliban have proved this. I do agree that the money we have invested into our military has helped many people in other countries, as we have been able to protect innocent lives in countries where the government has collapsed, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our military has helped many people live more prosperous lives and has brought democracy to places that would have never been seen otherwise.

Because as you said, people may have unconscious biases against women in STEM, if they work in HR, they may skip applications of female applicants. Having a quota will enforce these people to look through every application. But I do admit that there's a con with having a quota which is women are not competing with men but women for the quota when looking for job, but I still feel like the quota is a very good starting point for eradicating (hopefully) gender biases, and once it becomes a norm, company can put out other hiring policies.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The media has portrayed these incidents to be much more common than they actually are, which has fueled the public reaction to be greater than necessary.  The public reaction has largely overlooked the fact that the majority of these incidents have been started with a suspect resisting a lawful arrest.  It has focused almost exclusively on the officer's actions and ignored the fact that nothing detrimental would have occurred had the suspect complied with the officer's orders.  There has also been rioting and destruction by some in the public that has not accomplished anything positive.  Another overreaction is in the public's call for an immediate termination or filing of criminal charges against an officer when there has not been adequate time to conduct a thorough investigation of the officer's actions.",I understand that in order for the situation to have been escalated someone had to have done something wrong to start with. the person in question might have been combative but they should not have to lose their life because they came in contact with law enforcement. the deeper issue is that police treat humans like potential quotas and they are always suspicious even if someone does not do anything wrong. this is really the reason why the police need to be held accountable for the things they do wrong.,R_1q7Ic2Zm3WX4OV9_2,"I understand where you are coming from and truth be told I sort of agree that the reactions can be overblown and the media is just in there for the views. However, I believe we can see things from the view of the victims as well especially how often these issues come up and how the police seem to be targeting blacks, criminals or no. You can put yourself in the shoes of these blacks. How would you feel being asked to comply with police for just existing?
