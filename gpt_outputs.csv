787,"When a sexual assault accusation is made on a college campus, the alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus to protect the well-being of the victim.",The perpetrator should be removed so that the victim has piece of mind. They will probably be in a horrible state of mind due to the incident. The perpetrator should also be removed because this is a serious crime and they will most likely be in jail due to the act. I think there should be no reason why they should still be allowed to be on campus. What if they do it again? There should be no chances taken.,"I understand what you are stating and I agree with you on your stance  that the perpetrator should be removed from campus to prevent reoccurrence. However,  I think it is wise to remind ourselves ""Innocent until proven guilty.""  The discrepancy is astounding  with how many accusations are unfounded each year ?  I have included a link for your review.  "" In an analysis of sexual-assault cases at a large university for a 10-year period, a study found that 44.9% of cases “did not proceed” – meaning the incident did not meet the legal standard of assault, there was insufficient evidence, or the accuser was uncooperative.  David Lisak, Lori Gardinier, Sarah C. Nicksa, and Ashley M. Cote, “False Allegations of Sexual Assault: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases,” Violence Against Women 16(12) 1318-1334 (2010).http://notavictim.tyla.org/accused/guide-college-students/   As you can see with this information there are numerous individuals who have been accused, lost their reputation, not given a fair ""judging"" of their peers, lost scholarships and the right to continue with their education. I strongly believe any and all accusations should not be disclosed to the student body until there have been formal charges brought to light. Specifically names, exact place of occurrence.  While it is important to make the staff and student body aware of a potential incident we also have a duty to protect the rights and privacy of both parties for fear of lawsuits, aggression and other acts of violence that can be preventable. I certainly don't want to stir the pot sort of speak because I do not know all the evidence and I do not know the individuals or their history.","In response to the opposing view that the alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus, I agree with the stance that removal is necessary to prevent reoccurrence. However, it is essential to remember the principle of ""Innocent until proven guilty."" The discrepancy in the number of unfounded accusations each year is significant. For example, a study on sexual assault cases at a large university over a 10-year period found that nearly half of the cases did not proceed due to lack of evidence or cooperation from the accuser.

I believe all accusations should be handled with caution and not disclosed to the student body until formal charges are brought forward. While it is important to raise awareness about potential incidents, it is crucial to protect the rights and privacy of both parties to prevent lawsuits, aggression, and other acts of violence. Without knowing all the evidence or the individuals involved, it is important to proceed with caution and avoid jumping to conclusions.","I understand and agree with your perspective that the alleged perpetrator should be removed from campus to prevent any potential reoccurrence. However, it is important to keep in mind the principle of ""Innocent until proven guilty."" The statistics on unfounded accusations are quite significant, as shown in a study of sexual assault cases at a large university over a 10-year period. This information highlights the need to approach such situations with caution and fairness.

It is vital to consider the consequences of disclosing accusations before formal charges are brought forward, as it can have a detrimental impact on individuals' reputations and rights. While it is crucial to address potential incidents, it is also essential to protect the privacy and rights of all parties involved to minimize the risk of legal issues and further harm.

Without knowing all the evidence and the individuals involved, it is important to proceed with caution and respect for due process. This approach helps to maintain fairness, respect privacy, and prevent unnecessary conflicts.","I understand and agree with your perspective that the alleged perpetrator should be removed to prevent reoccurrence. However, it's crucial to remember ""Innocent until proven guilty."" The discrepancy is astounding. I've included a link for your review. With this information, it's clear that not all accusations are founded. It's important to protect the rights and privacy of both parties. I do not want to stir the pot without knowing all the evidence and individuals involved."
1068,"The United States should invest greater economic, military, and human resources in fighting the spread of ISIS and similar organizations around the world.","The United States should not focus its efforts on fighting terrorist groups like ISIS. It would be a much better use of resources to focus on fighting hunger, climate change, lack of education and humanitarian problems such at those in foreign, and especially low-income, countries. In the long run this would have the effect of reducing terrorism because when people have stable lives and do not worry about their day-to-day survival they are less likely to become radicalized. Also, it would be a more efficient use of money and resources to put it toward humanitarian aid because a little can go a long way for people who are living on less than $2 per day. With military and counter-terrorism funding, you just keep spending and spending and the problem doesn't go away. Note that the U.S. has been trying to ""solve"" terrorism in Afghanistan for over two decades and still has not ""fixed"" anything.","I agree the United States should not be focused on fighting ISIS. I see your point, we have bigger problems right now like inflation, homelessness, racial discrimination, and much more. I believe that the US should focus on fixing the unsolved issues in our country first before worrying about anything else.","One possible way to rephrase the response could be: ""I understand and agree that the United States should prioritize addressing issues such as inflation, homelessness, and racial discrimination before focusing on fighting ISIS. It is crucial to first address the unresolved problems within our own country before tackling external threats.""","I agree that the United States should not prioritize fighting ISIS. I understand your perspective that there are more pressing issues to address, such as inflation, homelessness, racial discrimination, and other domestic concerns. I believe that resolving these unresolved issues within our own country should take precedence before allocating resources to external matters.","I understand your perspective on the matter - I agree that the United States should not be solely focused on fighting ISIS. It is true that we have pressing issues at home, such as inflation, homelessness, and racial discrimination, that require our attention. I believe that addressing these unresolved issues within our country should take priority before we consider other global concerns."
348,"When a sexual assault accusation is made on a college campus, the alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus to protect the well-being of the victim.","The alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus, though not necessarily immediately expelled without due process.  The removal is for the mental and physical safety of the victim, which is the most important thing.  It shows that the school supports the victim and that sexual violence will not be tolerated.  At that point, the school and police authorities can begin their investigation, but the victim can feel safer that he or she won't run into that person in class or in other school buildings.  The vast, vast majority of alleged victims are telling the truth.  There are always exceptions, but these are few and far between.  We must believe victims and must assume that they are telling the truth, so immediate removal of the accused is certainly necessary, for the safety of the accuser as well as other women on campus.  If an investigation concludes that the assault did not happen, the appropriate corrections can be made at that time.  But it is important to err on the side of caution and protecting victims.","I do feel that you need to trust and believe the victim but you must also give trust and belief to the accused.  We are in a society where you are innocent until proven guilty.  The accused should be detained, questioned and then a decision should be made.  I have first hand experience where my roommate was accused of attacking a woman and after several hours of questions and conversations the girl said, ""I lied, I cheated on my boyfriend and didn't want him to be mad at me and break up"".  She almost ruined someone else's life and if he were ""removed"" from campus it would have had a greater negative impact on his life.","It is important to trust and believe the victim, but it is equally important to extend that trust and belief to the accused. In our society, the principle of innocence until proven guilty should be upheld. The accused should undergo questioning and detention before any decisions are made. I have personally witnessed a situation where my roommate was falsely accused of assault. After thorough questioning, it was revealed that the accuser had lied to cover up infidelity. This experience highlights the potential dangers of immediate removal without due process, as it could have had a devastating impact on the accused's life.","I appreciate your perspective on the importance of supporting and protecting victims of sexual assault. It is crucial to create a safe environment for the victim and ensure that their well-being is a top priority. However, it is also important to consider the rights of the accused and the principle of innocent until proven guilty in our society.

In cases of sexual assault accusations on college campuses, it is essential to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the truth. The alleged perpetrator should be questioned and detained as necessary, while still ensuring their rights are respected. This balanced approach allows for a fair process and prevents potential harm to the accused.

Your example of a false accusation highlights the complexity of these situations and emphasizes the need for careful consideration before taking action. While it is crucial to believe and support victims, it is also important to approach the situation with caution and fairness to all parties involved.

Ultimately, by acknowledging and respecting both perspectives, we can work towards a system that prioritizes justice and safety for all individuals on campus.",I appreciate your perspective and understand the importance of trusting and believing both the victim and the accused. It is crucial to remember that individuals are innocent until proven guilty. The accused should undergo questioning before any decision is made. I have personally witnessed a situation where false accusations almost had devastating consequences. It is essential to consider both sides in order to prevent unjust outcomes.
1424,The public reaction to recent confrontations between police and minority crime suspects has been overblown.,"While there have been some outright excessive force issues, some unfortunately resulting in the death of minorities at the hands of police, I feel that social media has contributed to the problem by repeatedly replaying these incidents while doing nothing to improve dialogue and truly analyze the data on police use of excessive force against minorities.","I do not agree with this statement. The recent (social) media coverage is not exaggerating the topic. Rather, it is drawing attention to a longstanding issue that many of us were not aware of. No amount of discrimination based on rase or other factors is ok in this day and age.","I do not agree with this statement. The recent (social) media coverage is not exaggerating the topic. Instead, it is shining a light on a longstanding issue that many of us were previously unaware of. Discrimination based on race or any other factor is unacceptable in this day and age.","I understand your perspective, but I respectfully disagree with the statement. In my view, the recent media coverage is not inflating the issue but rather shedding light on a long-standing problem that many may not have been aware of. It is important to address any form of discrimination, regardless of race or other factors, in our society today.","I understand your perspective, but I must respectfully disagree. The recent media coverage is shedding light on a significant issue that has been overlooked for too long. Discrimination based on race or any other factor is simply unacceptable today."
699,"When a sexual assault accusation is made on a college campus, the alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus to protect the well-being of the victim.",The victim could feel more fear from having the alleged perpetrator near them on the same campus in the same area as them. Having the perpetrator removed would be beneficial to those around campus and allow for investigation to increase. There would be more safety initiated if the perpetrator was removed to protect the campus. There would be less victims by the same perpetrator if they were removed.,"In such a situation we must consider the rights of both the accuser and the accused. Like in the legal system, the accused should be considered innocent until proven guilty. An investigation should be conducted before any action is taken against an accused person to avoid punishing the falsely accused. There are other steps that can be taken to protect victims that do not infringe the rights of the accused.","When a sexual assault accusation is made on a college campus, it is important to consider the rights of both the accuser and the accused. Just like in the legal system, individuals should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

There are alternative measures that can be implemented to protect victims without violating the rights of the accused.","In this scenario, it is important to carefully consider the perspectives of both the accuser and the accused. Just as in the legal system, it is crucial to uphold the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.

There are alternative measures that can be implemented to safeguard victims without compromising the rights of the accused."
786,"When a sexual assault accusation is made on a college campus, the alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus to protect the well-being of the victim.",The reason why I think they should immediately be removed from campus to protect the victim's well being is because statistics back up that false sexual assault reports rarely exist. It is much more easy to just believe the victim instead of the alleged abuser. This is important because we want the victim to feel safe while they are trying to recover and continue on with their education. If you don't do this it'll send a message that you're okay with it. That's not what we should do.,"I think that the alleged perpetrator should not be immediately removed from campus. After all, the justice system still follows an ""innocent until proven guilty"" principle. There should be a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances before any punishment is given. There can be other ways to protect the victim during this period of time, such as a restraining order.","I believe that it may be more appropriate to refrain from immediately removing the alleged perpetrator from campus. It is essential to adhere to the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" within the justice system. Prior to issuing any form of punishment, a comprehensive investigation into the facts and circumstances should be conducted. Additionally, alternative measures, such as obtaining a restraining order, can be implemented to ensure the safety and well-being of the victim during this critical period.","I understand the perspective that immediate removal of the alleged perpetrator can help protect the victim's well-being, as false reports of sexual assault are rare and it is crucial to prioritize the victim's safety and recovery.

371,The public reaction to recent confrontations between police and minority crime suspects has been overblown.,"I completely agree with this statement.  There is an estimated 400,000 police contacts each day with people in the United States.  The narrative you see in the media and pushed by certain groups would make you think that a large number of these contacts are adversarial up to include a high number of violence from the police towards the public.  This is simply not true.  Think about how many times you have seen officers acting inappropriately on the news.  Compare that to 400,000 each day.  The numbers just dont support this narrative.  Like in any profession you have some police officers that should not be police officers and sometimes they act like criminals.","The number seems low because minorities make up only a fraction of the overall population, therefore directly relating numbers to a dynamic problem doesn't quite work straightforwardly. Most of the time, families that have to deal with the aftermath of a police brutality case oftentimes aren't taken seriously and their cases end up brushed under the rug and not given proper media attention. Oftentimes, it even takes going viral on social media for these families to even see a proper, official response to their case. ""Good"" police officers do exist, however, when the industry is known for protecting each other despite the crimes committed, the bad apples tend to spoil the bunch.","The opposing view raises valid points regarding the number of daily police contacts, but it's essential to consider the disproportionate impact on minorities in these situations. The narrative portrayed in the media may not accurately reflect the experiences of marginalized communities, as cases of police brutality often go unnoticed and unaddressed. While there are undoubtedly ""good"" police officers, the systemic issues within law enforcement can allow misconduct to go unchecked, tarnishing the reputation of the entire profession.","It's interesting to consider the different perspectives on this issue. While it's true that there are a large number of daily police contacts, particularly in a country as populous as the United States, it's important to remember that minorities may experience these interactions differently. The fact that cases of police brutality involving minorities often go unnoticed or receive minimal media attention is a concerning factor. In such situations, it often takes social media attention for these cases to receive the proper response they deserve. It's worth acknowledging that there are indeed good police officers, but the issue arises when the system fails to address and hold accountable those who do not uphold the expected standards of conduct.","It's important to consider that the number may seem low due to the fact that minorities represent only a fraction of the total population. It's not always straightforward to directly relate numbers to a complex issue. Families affected by police brutality often struggle to receive adequate attention for their cases and are sometimes not taken seriously. In many cases, these families only receive official responses after their stories go viral on social media. While there are certainly ""good"" police officers, the tendency for the industry to protect its own, even in the face of wrongdoing, can allow misconduct to go unchecked and tarnish the reputation of law enforcement as a whole."
881,"When a sexual assault accusation is made on a college campus, the alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus to protect the well-being of the victim.","To immediately remove someone who has been accused of a crime is against their rights. You cannot place judgement until proof is given, an accusation alone is not enough and is unfair to all involved. It would be better for the accuser to remove themselves until it is proven to be true. If someone is accused of assault and then forcibly removed, and after that they are proven innocent, they definitely have a case to sue against the establishment.","I understand how you feel that people are innocent until proven guilty, however, if a person is accused of sexual assault, that person should be removed immediately. Yes, they might be proven innocent later but what happens if they do it again? What happens if they kill the next person? We have seen how easy it is for students to do online instruction so we know that the accused can still go to school while not going to campus. To say that the accuser is better suited to be removed can be seen as nothing short of victim shaming. However, removing both parties could be a compromise until the investigation is completed.","I understand your viewpoint on the presumption of innocence, but in cases of sexual assault accusations on college campuses, it is crucial to prioritize the safety and well-being of the victim. While it is true that the accused individual may be found innocent later on, there is always a risk of potential harm if they remain on campus. It is also important to consider the possibility of re-offending. In this situation, it may be beneficial to temporarily remove both parties until a thorough investigation is conducted.

However, in cases of sexual assault accusations on a college campus, immediate removal of the accused is necessary to protect the well-being of the victim.

712,"The United States should invest greater economic, military, and human resources in fighting the spread of ISIS and similar organizations around the world.","The reason that I disagree with this topic is that we need to be more focused on our own citizens first. Of course, the safety of threats is important as well, but it should not be our sole focus. I believe that we should invest our economy and resources in helping our people, especially those on low socioeconomic status levels. The military can focus on threats of outside forces, while we focus internally on aiding those around us and those in need of help. We are doing a disservice if we do not take care of our home before worrying about others.",Focusing on ISIS and other terror groups is in fact helping Americans at home.  They did attack us here in the states and the lesson learned from that is to hit them first and not allow them to go on the offensive targeting us or our interests.  We should focus our military and other resources on our enemies and not waste time on the Woke ideology that is taking over our armed forces.,"When engaging with the opposing view that prioritizes internal issues over combating threats like ISIS, consider reframing your response to convey a more receptive tone. For example, you could say: ""While I understand the importance of focusing on domestic concerns, it is crucial to address external threats like ISIS in order to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home. By proactively targeting these terror groups, we can prevent future attacks and protect our citizens and interests.

1362,"In order to increase the representation of women in math, sciences and engineering, female graduates with relevant degrees should be given priority in hiring decisions over men.","As a woman in STEM, my primary consideration is feeling that I have a fair shot at any position that a man has. I don't expect any preferential treatment or gender-based affirmative action policies to compensate for past gender discrimination in STEM, though. There's a perception in some workplaces with these policies that women were only hired to fill a quota, perpetuating the gender divide. I wouldn't want there to be any doubts about my suitability for the position due to my merit, rather than my gender. Of course, people who hire for STEM positions may have unconscious (or conscious) gender biases, but I think that having a diverse hiring panel would be a better policy than implementing gender quotas.","While I agree that a diverse hiring panel would be helpful in increasing the representation of women in STEM, I think giving preference to women over men, given the same set of qualifications, may more effectively close the gender gap in STEM. I know the word ""quota"" rubs people the wrong way, and I can understand that - it rubs me the wrong way. However, establishing some sort of system or algorithm that prioritizes hiring women over men - again, when their qualifications are the same - would remove unconscious, internalized bias from the decision making process, and potentially better increase women's representation in STEM. This need not be a permanent solution. Exposure to women in the work field over time would naturally help reduce hiring bias, eventually removing the need for ""quotas"" as hiring naturally become more equitable.","In order to enhance the representation of women in math, sciences, and engineering fields, female graduates with relevant degrees should be given preference in hiring decisions over men.

Implementing a system that focuses on qualifications rather than gender could help mitigate unconscious biases in the hiring process and contribute to a more balanced representation of women in STEM.

Nevertheless, implementing a system or algorithm that gives preference to women in hiring decisions when qualifications are equal could help eliminate unconscious biases and contribute to greater gender diversity in STEM. It's important to note that this doesn't have to be a permanent measure. As more women are exposed to the STEM work field, biases in hiring practices may naturally diminish, eventually rendering such quotas unnecessary as the hiring process becomes more equitable.","Although I agree that having a diverse hiring panel would be beneficial to increasing women's representation in STEM, I believe that granting preference to women over men, with equal qualifications, could be more effective in bridging the gender gap.

401,The public reaction to recent confrontations between police and minority crime suspects has been overblown.,I believe that the media serves as one of the number one factors in why the confrontations are overblown. 10 years ago we did not have social media. Every incident that happened couldn't be recorded and posted to the internet immediately. I believe that we had the same types of issues going on the public just didn't have as much instant access to the information and to see videos of the actual footage.

It's true that social media has drastically increased the speed and reach of information sharing, leading to a heightened awareness of these incidents.

537,"In order to increase the representation of women in math, sciences and engineering, female graduates with relevant degrees should be given priority in hiring decisions over men.","The whole point of feminism is so that both women, men, and any other genders are treated as equals. Giving a competitive edge to women for hiring that is not based on job qualifications and skills seems counter productive to the whole point of feminism.

Something like requiring a gender balance on the hiring committee like half male half female so the candidate receives a relatively more fair and balanced interview.","Personally I agree, I think that pushing or forcing companies to hire women in these industries just on the basis that they are women, is counter productive. Even if the women are just as qualified as their male counterparts. I do think however it is greatly important to have more of a balance with the cis genders in the workplace. Do I have a solution as to how to make this happen? No. However it is something that needs to be done.","I personally agree that simply pushing for or forcing companies to hire women solely based on their gender can be counterproductive, even if the women are equally qualified as their male counterparts. However, I do believe it is crucial to strive for a more balanced representation of genders in the workplace. While I don't have a specific solution on how to achieve this, I do believe it is a necessary step that needs to be taken.","I see where you're coming from and I appreciate your perspective. I agree that simply giving women a competitive edge in hiring based solely on their gender may not be the most effective approach, even if they are equally qualified. I also believe it's crucial to strive for more gender balance in workplaces, including in STEM industries. While I may not have a concrete solution for achieving this balance, I do recognize the importance of working towards it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this complex issue.","I appreciate your perspective on this issue. I also believe that simply giving women preferential treatment in hiring can be counterproductive, even if they are equally qualified. It is essential to strive for a more balanced workplace in terms of gender representation. Though I may not have a clear solution on how to achieve this balance, I agree that it is a necessary step forward."
934,"When a sexual assault accusation is made on a college campus, the alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus to protect the well-being of the victim.","Of course a sexual assault allegation is a serious matter and should be treated as such. A victim should have the right to be believed in their accusation, however one of the major tenets of our judicial system and our society even is the right of the accused to be considered innocent until proven guilty. It is this basic right, enshrined in our constitution that protects citizens from unjust, vengeful or malicious persecution. I would be fine with a victim having extra physical or restraining order protection if deemed necessary, but the rights of the accused are just as important as those of the accuser. There may be limited circumstances where an accused person may need to be barred from campus or otherwise restrained, such as previous violent convictions or documented behavior.","I believe that any student be it male or female that have made sexual advances toward the opposite sex should be banned from the campus until further investigation. When some one is accused of sexual assault or rape, it is automatically believed by the accuser.  It is your job to prove your innocence, but in the mean time your reputation is scarred for life.","and I can assist you in rephrasing the writer's response to the opposing view.

A possible rephrased response could be: ""I think that any student, regardless of gender, who is accused of making sexual advances towards another student should be temporarily expelled from the campus pending a thorough investigation. In cases of sexual assault or rape allegations, the accuser's claims are often automatically believed, making it necessary for the accused to prove their innocence. While it is important to protect the well-being of the victim, it is also crucial to respect the rights of the accused. It may be appropriate to consider barring a student from campus or implementing other restrictions if there is evidence of previous violent behavior or criminal convictions.""","I understand and respect your perspective on the importance of protecting the rights of the accused in cases of sexual assault allegations on college campuses. It is indeed a fundamental principle of our justice system to presume innocence until guilt is proven. I agree that there may be circumstances, such as previous violent convictions or documented behavior, where barring an accused individual from campus may be warranted for the safety of the community. 

However, I also believe that it is crucial to prioritize the well-being of the victim in such situations. Allowing the alleged perpetrator to remain on campus during an investigation could potentially retraumatize the victim and compromise their sense of safety. It is important for the university to take proactive measures to support and protect all parties involved, while also ensuring fairness and due process for the accused.

Perhaps there can be a middle ground where temporary restrictions are put in place, such as extra physical or restraining order protection, until a thorough investigation is conducted. This approach can help balance the rights of both the accuser and the accused, while also preventing any potential harm or distress to the victim. Ultimately, creating a safe and supportive environment for all students should be the top priority in these challenging and sensitive situations.","I understand the importance of protecting individuals who make sexual assault allegations on college campuses. It is essential to consider the well-being of the victim in these situations. However, it is also crucial to uphold the right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty – a fundamental principle in our judicial system. While immediate removal from campus may not always be necessary, in cases where there is a history of violent convictions or documented concerning behavior, additional measures may be warranted. It is important to strike a balance between protecting the victim and ensuring fairness for the accused."
1704,"In order to increase the representation of women in math, sciences and engineering, female graduates with relevant degrees should be given priority in hiring decisions over men.","I work in a healthcare field currently, working with mostly women. Men doing my same role and duties are sometimes mistaken to be physicians merely because they are men. In order to change this viewpoint, we need to see women in these roles as they are just as qualified and dedicated to this type of work. It is not just about stigma of men versus women. It is about empowering women in STEM fields. They are not recognized and should be built up in these fields.","I understand your point and I agree. I think it is important to include women in different areas of work, it is a fact that they are qualified for any type of work. I think it is important to highlight that it doesn't matter if you are a woman or a man, the main thing is your knowledge and dedication to the job.","Thank you for bringing up this important perspective. I completely agree with you on the significance of including women in various fields of work. It is a fact that women are just as qualified for any type of work. It is crucial to emphasize that what truly matters is one's knowledge and dedication to the job, regardless of gender.","I understand and appreciate your perspective. I agree that it is crucial to involve women in various fields of work, as they are indeed qualified for all types of roles. It's important to emphasize that one's gender should not determine their abilities, but rather their skills and commitment to the job. Let's continue to empower women in STEM fields and recognize their valuable contributions.","I appreciate your perspective and I agree. It is essential to incorporate women into various fields. Women are undoubtedly qualified for any job. The focus should be on knowledge and dedication, regardless of gender."
1080,"When a sexual assault accusation is made on a college campus, the alleged perpetrator should be immediately removed from campus to protect the well-being of the victim.","Having someone immediately removed from a campus just because someone made an accusation against them is a little ridiculous. This type of precedent sets up mainly male students but could also set up female students as well to be in a position where they are in constant fear. This fear would come from knowing that if they say the wrong thing or act the wrong way they could be taken off campus without proof. Now if there is immediate proof then I completely agree that they should be kicked out, however without a good amount of evidence to prove something happened then I think kicking the students off campus should wait.","I mean, if somebody is engaging in sexual misconduct on a campus, it really is best just to remove them. These allegations are generally not thrown around lightly. It's not like innocent men are getting accused of sexual misconduct left and right. These men acted in ways that made another human being feel unsafe or predated upon- that should not happen. If you make somebody feel unsafe, you should suffer the consequences, even if YOU think it wasn't that bad. On top of that, statute of limitations see so many sexual offenders get away with it, so I am VERY much all for women getting men their comeuppance as soon as they feel it has happened. If you're not a scumbag, you have nothing to worry about.","In response to the opposing view, the writer could rephrase their statement to appear more receptive to the other person by saying:
""I understand your concerns about the possibility of false accusations leading to unjust removal from campus. However, it's crucial to prioritize the well-being and safety of potential victims of sexual misconduct. Allegations of this nature are serious and should be taken seriously. If someone's actions have made another person feel unsafe or violated, it's important to address the situation promptly. While evidence is crucial, we must also consider the emotional and psychological impact on the victim. It's about creating a safe and supportive environment for all students on campus.""","I understand where you're coming from, but in cases of sexual misconduct on a college campus, it may be prudent to consider removing the alleged perpetrator for the well-being of the victim. It's important to acknowledge that false accusations are not common, and the priority should be to ensure the safety of all individuals on campus. While it's crucial to have evidence to support any accusations, waiting to take action could potentially put others at risk. Ultimately, if someone's actions make another person feel unsafe, it's essential for there to be consequences. Additionally, the issue of statute of limitations often allows sexual offenders to escape accountability, making it even more important to address allegations promptly. By addressing these issues promptly, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive environment for everyone on campus.","Well, if somebody is engaging in sexual misconduct on a campus, it may be best to consider removing them. These allegations are usually taken seriously and not made lightly. It's important to address actions that make others feel unsafe or preyed upon. If someone causes fear or discomfort, consequences should follow, even if they may not view it as a serious offense. Additionally, many sexual offenders escape punishment due to statute of limitations, so efforts to hold them accountable should be supported. If one has acted appropriately, there should be no cause for concern."
1479,"The United States should invest greater economic, military, and human resources in fighting the spread of ISIS and similar organizations around the world.","The reason that I disagree with this topic is that we need to be more focused on our own citizens first. Of course, the safety of threats is important as well, but it should not be our sole focus. I believe that we should invest our economy and resources in helping our people, especially those on low socioeconomic status levels. The military can focus on threats of outside forces, while we focus internally on aiding those around us and those in need of help. We are doing a disservice if we do not take care of our home before worrying about others.","Focusing on ISIS and other terror groups is in fact helping Americans at home.  They did attack us here in the states and the lesson learned from that is to hit them first and not allow them to go on the offensive targeting us or our interests.  We should focus our military and other resources on our enemies and not waste time on the Woke ideology that is taking over our armed forces.  I acknowledge the fact that there are those on lower social economic levels here in the US that need help however we should not make them dependent on handouts.  Kennedy once said,  ""Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.  Teach him to fish and you feed him for life.""  The aforementioned is from my recall and is paraphrased.","In response to the opposing view, it is important to consider that investing resources in fighting ISIS and similar organizations can also benefit Americans at home. This is because these groups have targeted and attacked the United States in the past, making it crucial to prevent further attacks by taking proactive measures. By focusing our military and resources on combating these threats, we are protecting the safety and security of our citizens and interests.

While addressing the needs of individuals on lower socioeconomic levels within the country is also essential, it is possible to strike a balance between internal aid and external defense. Rather than creating dependence on handouts, it may be more sustainable to empower individuals by providing opportunities for self-sufficiency, as expressed in the quote attributed to Kennedy about teaching a man to fish. 

Therefore, in prioritizing the safety and well-being of Americans, a strategic approach that includes addressing both domestic needs and external threats can be beneficial in ensuring overall security and prosperity.","I appreciate your perspective on the importance of helping our own citizens first. It's undeniable that addressing internal needs is vital, especially for those on low socioeconomic levels. However, I believe that focusing on combating organizations like ISIS can actually benefit Americans at home. By preventing attacks on our soil and interests, we ensure the safety and security of our people. It's crucial to prioritize the protection of our nation from external threats. While I agree that addressing the needs of those in need is essential, I also believe in empowering individuals to become self-sufficient rather than dependent on handouts, as famously emphasized by Kennedy's quote about teaching a man to fish. Ultimately, I believe a balanced approach that addresses both internal and external challenges is key to ensuring the well-being of our citizens.","Focusing on ISIS and other terror groups is actually beneficial for Americans at home. Addressing threats before they strike us is crucial. While aiding those in need domestically is important, we should also prioritize national security. It is possible to help our own citizens and protect our country simultaneously. Kennedy's quote about teaching a man to fish instead of giving him a fish highlights the importance of self-sufficiency."
1046,The public reaction to recent confrontations between police and minority crime suspects has been overblown.,"Yes it has been overblown.  The media has portrayed these incidents to be much more common than they actually are, which has fueled the public reaction to be greater than necessary.  The public reaction has largely overlooked the fact that the majority of these incidents have been started with a suspect resisting a lawful arrest.  It has focused almost exclusively on the officer's actions and ignored the fact that nothing detrimental would have occurred had the suspect complied with the officer's orders.  There has also been rioting and destruction by some in the public that has not accomplished anything positive.  Another overreaction is in the public's call for an immediate termination or filing of criminal charges against an officer when there has not been adequate time to conduct a thorough investigation of the officer's actions.",I understand that in order for the situation to have been escalated someone had to have done something wrong to start with. the person in question might have been combative but they should not have to lose their life because they came in contact with law enforcement. the deeper issue is that police treat humans like potential quotas and they are always suspicious even if someone does not do anything wrong. this is really the reason why the police need to be held accountable for the things they do wrong.,"I appreciate your perspective on the recent confrontations between police and minority crime suspects. It is important to acknowledge that the situations may have been escalated by some individuals' behavior, but it is concerning when encounters with law enforcement result in such severe outcomes. It raises questions about the underlying issue of how individuals are treated by the police and the need for accountability in law enforcement actions.","I understand that initial actions from the suspect may have triggered the situation. It is true that individuals should not lose their lives when encountering law enforcement. The underlying concern here is how law enforcement perceives individuals as potential quotas and approaches them with unwarranted suspicion, even when no wrongdoing has occurred. Holding police accountable for their actions is essential in addressing this issue.","I understand that the situation escalated due to someone's actions. While the person involved may have been combative, losing their life in encounters with law enforcement is not justified. The overarching issue is how police view individuals as potential quotas, always suspicious even when no wrongdoing has occurred. This is why accountability for police misconduct is crucial."
591,"In order to increase the representation of women in math, sciences and engineering, female graduates with relevant degrees should be given priority in hiring decisions over men.","Women have been historically underrepresented in the fields of math, science and engineering. For a good part of the 20th century, women weren't admitted into advanced University programs in these disciplines. The only way to correct this under- representation is to give priority to qualified women in hiring decisions. This presupposes that male and female candidates are equally qualified. There may be political discussion about unfair affirmative action, but there is no other viable way to correct the historical imbalance.","This is a weak argument because it is only true in theory. There will never be two equal candidates, one will always have a strength or weakness the other may not have. The best person for the job should always be hired, that can be due to qualifications or just a better fit for the team. Typically in these fields soft skills are lacking too. The solution would be continue to push women in to STEM fields. Among older populations there is generally less interest in STEM but as the population gets younger, there is more of an interest. The gap is not due to sexism (on a large scale) but the amount of women who have worked to be in these fields. This number will only continue to grow as the younger population moves in.","The statement can be adjusted to: ""It is important to recognize that while prioritizing female graduates with relevant degrees in hiring decisions is crucial for increasing women's representation in math, sciences, and engineering, the best candidate should always be chosen based on qualifications and fit for the team. It is important to continue encouraging women to pursue STEM fields to address historical imbalances and bridge the gap in representation. As the younger population shows more interest in STEM fields, the number of women in these fields will continue to grow naturally.""","I appreciate your perspective on the historical underrepresentation of women in math, science, and engineering fields. It is true that there have been significant barriers to entry for women in these fields in the past. 

While I understand your suggestion to prioritize qualified women in hiring decisions to address this imbalance, I believe that the best candidate should always be chosen based on qualifications and fit for the team. It is important to recognize that each candidate brings unique strengths and weaknesses to the table.

Furthermore, I agree that promoting and encouraging more women to pursue STEM fields is crucial in closing the gender gap. As the younger population shows more interest in these fields, the representation of women in math, science, and engineering will continue to grow. 

Overall, I believe that by focusing on promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM fields, we can create a more balanced and skilled workforce for the future. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this important issue.","This is a valid point to consider. In reality, it is rare to have two candidates with exactly the same qualifications. It is important to prioritize the best fit for the job, whether that be based on qualifications or team dynamics. Soft skills are also crucial in these fields. Encouraging more women to enter STEM fields is a step in the right direction. As the younger generation shows more interest in STEM, the gender gap may naturally decrease. It is not solely about sexism, but rather the historical lack of women in these fields. As more women pursue careers in math, science, and engineering, the representation of women in these fields will continue to increase."
